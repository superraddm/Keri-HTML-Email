<head><!--This content type tells a web browser how to interperet your special characters. However:
    EVERY EMAIL CLIENT WILL IGNORE THIS META TAG. Instead the content-type will be set in the header of your email.  The 
    header is created based on the server configuration which is controlled by your email service provider.  Here is more info:

<body><!-- You may adjust each of the values above for your template as needed. 
 
We've included the style attribute for Gmail because it does not support embedded CSS and it will convert this body tag to 
a div. Since it gets converted to a div, the other body attributes like bgcolor are ignored.  
 
We included body attributes (alink, link, bgcolor and text) for Lotus Notes 6.5 and 7, as these clients do not offer much 
support for embedded nor inline CSS. 
 
The "min-height" attribute is set for Gmail and AOL since they will be converting this body tag to a div and we want our 
background color to reach the bottom of the page. 
 
The yahoo attribute is added if you are using media queries for mobile devices.  For an explanation, check out the media 
queries example in the style block below. --><!--PAGE WRAPPER-->
<div><!--This div is working as a wrapper and the body_style is picking up our CSS properties for AOL. The padding has been 
    included for Gmail, you can adjust this to your liking.
     
    If your email exceeds 23 inches in height, you might end up with unwanted horizontal spacing halfway down your email in 
    Outlook 2007 and 2010:
    The reason: http://www.emailonacid.com/blog/details/C13/horizontal_spacing_issues_in_outlook_2007_and_2010
    The fix: Just change this wrapper from a div to a span and add style="display:block" - don't forget to change the closing tag 
    as well.  From there, stack your tables within your email so that no table exeeds 23 inches.  
    Here is another example: http://www.emailonacid.com/blog/details/C13/background_colors_in_html_emails
